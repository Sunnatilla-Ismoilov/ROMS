Architecture
The application follows a typical client-server architecture:

Frontend: The React application consumes the RESTful API provided by the backend, rendering data dynamically and ensuring a responsive user experience.
Backend: The Node.js server handles API requests, business logic, and interacts with the MongoDB database.
Database: MongoDB stores data related to orders, users, and payment transactions.
Authentication and Security
JWT Authentication: Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.
Role-Based Access Control: Different user roles (e.g., admin, staff) can be defined to restrict access to sensitive operations.
Payment Processing
Stripe Integration: Handles the entire payment process from capturing payment details to processing and confirming transactions.
Secure Transactions: Ensures that all payment data is handled securely using Stripe's robust payment platform.
Styling and User Interface
TailwindCSS: Utilizes a utility-first approach to quickly style components.
shadcn/ui: Provides a set of pre-built, customizable UI components that are used to build the interface, ensuring consistency and a modern look.
